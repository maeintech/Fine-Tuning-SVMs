# Fine-Tuning-SVMs
This repository contains a tutorial on Fine-Tuning Support Vector Machines (SVMs), focusing on two critical aspects:

Hyperparameter Tuning: Understanding how parameters like the regularization parameter, C and kernel coefficient, gamma influence the performance of SVM models.
Feature Scaling: Exploring how scaling features ensures better model performance by preventing one feature from dominating the decision boundary.

The materials in this repository are designed to help you deepen your understanding of SVMs and how to optimize them for various machine learning tasks.

Repository Contents

Tutorial (PDF): A detailed explanation of the theory behind hyperparameter tuning and feature scaling in SVM models. This document explains the impact of different parameters on the model's decision boundaries and performance.
Practical Example (Jupyter Notebook): An interactive Python notebook demonstrating the implementation of the concepts discussed in the tutorial. This file includes code examples and visualizations of decision boundaries for different C and gamma values, as well as the effect of feature scaling on model performance.

Getting Started

To get started with the practical example, you will need:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
The following Python libraries: scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas

Running the Tutorial
Open the Support_Vector_MachinesTutorial.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
Follow the step-by-step guide in the notebook to run the practical examples and explore the impact of hyperparameters and feature scaling on SVM performance.
